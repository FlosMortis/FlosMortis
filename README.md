👋  Hi, I’m @FlosMortis
👀  I’m interested in web development, especially in creating responsive and interactive web applications that enhance user experience.
🌱  I’m currently learning React.js to expand my front-end development skills and delve into modern web development frameworks.
💞️  I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects or start-ups looking for a passionate front-end developer to bring their ideas to life.

⚡  Fun fact: When I'm not coding, I love to immerse myself in sports, especially boxing. I find great joy in teaching boxing classes 
     to children, sharing the discipline, focus, and confidence that comes with the sport.
